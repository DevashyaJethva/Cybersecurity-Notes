# 🛡 Defensive Security

Defensive Security is a protective approach to cybersecurity that focuses on preventing, detecting, and responding to cyber threats.

It involves implementing security measures to safeguard systems, networks, applications, and organizational data from unauthorized access and attacks.

Instead of simulating attacks like offensive security, defensive security concentrates on building strong protection mechanisms to block real attackers and minimize potential damage.

The primary goal of defensive security is to ensure the **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA)** of information while maintaining continuous and secure system operations.

## 🔁 Process of Defensive Security

Defensive security generally follows these steps:

1. **Prevention**  
   Implementing security controls such as firewalls, antivirus software, and encryption.

2. **Detection**  
   Monitoring systems and networks to identify potential threats.

3. **Analysis**  
   Investigating suspicious activities to determine their impact.

4. **Response**  
   Containing and mitigating security incidents.

5. **Recovery**  
   Restoring systems to normal operations after an attack.

6. **Improvement**  
   Updating security strategies based on lessons learned.
