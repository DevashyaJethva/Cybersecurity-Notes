#  Router vs Switch

---

#  Router

A router connects multiple networks and forwards packets between them.

Routers operate at:

- Layer 3 (Network Layer)

Routers use IP addresses.

---

## Routing

Routing is the process of selecting the best path for data.

Routing decisions depend on:

- shortest path
- reliability
- speed (fiber vs copper)

---

## Router Features

Routers usually provide:

- web interface / CLI configuration
- port forwarding configuration
- firewall rules
- network connection to internet

---

#  Switch

A switch connects multiple devices inside the same network.

Switches operate at:

- Layer 2 (Data Link)
- or Layer 3 (advanced switches)

---

## Layer 2 Switch

- forwards frames
- uses MAC addresses
- does not perform routing

---

## Layer 3 Switch

Layer 3 switches can:

- perform switching
- perform routing using IP addresses

#  Router vs Switch Comparison

| Feature | Router | Switch |
|--------|--------|--------|
| OSI Layer | Layer 3 | Layer 2 / Layer 3 |
| Uses | IP Address | MAC Address (Layer 2) |
| Main Function | Connects networks | Connects devices in LAN |
| Routing | Yes | Only Layer 3 switches |
| Port Forwarding | Yes | No |

---

# Short Summary

- Router connects different networks using IP.
- Switch connects devices inside the same network using MAC.
