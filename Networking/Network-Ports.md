# 🚪 Network Ports

Ports are communication endpoints in networking.

They act as channels through which data is sent and received.

Ports ensure that traffic reaches the correct application.

# 📌 What is a Port?

A port is a number between:
0 to 65535

Each application listens on a specific port.

If the port does not match, communication fails.

# ⭐ Why Ports Are Important

Without port standardization, networking would become chaotic.

Example:
- HTTP uses port 80
- HTTPS uses port 443
