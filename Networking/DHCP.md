#  DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)

IP addresses can be assigned in two ways:

- Manually (Static IP)
- Automatically using DHCP

**DHCP** automatically assigns IP addresses when a device connects to a network.

This reduces manual configuration errors and simplifies network management.

#  Purpose of DHCP

DHCP is used to provide:

- IP address
- subnet mask
- default gateway
- DNS server information

It is used in home, school, and enterprise networks.

#  How DHCP Works (DORA Process)

DHCP uses a four-step process called **DORA**:

---

## 1️ DHCP Discover
A device broadcasts a request asking:

**"Is there any DHCP server?"**

---

## 2️ DHCP Offer
The DHCP server replies with an offer containing:

- available IP address
- configuration details

---

## 3️ DHCP Request
The device requests the offered IP address.

---

## 4️ DHCP ACK (Acknowledgement)
The server confirms the IP assignment.

The device can now use the IP.

#  Importance of DHCP

DHCP is important because:

- saves time in large networks
- reduces configuration errors
- prevents IP conflicts
- simplifies network management
