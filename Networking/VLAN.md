#  VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network)

A VLAN allows devices on the same physical switch to be separated into different logical networks.

This provides:

- improved security
- segmentation
- controlled communication

#  Example

Sales Department:
192.168.1.1

Accounting Department:
192.168.2.1

Both departments can access the Internet but cannot communicate unless routing rules allow.
