# 🖧 Network Devices

Networking devices help connect systems, manage traffic, and enable communication across networks.

#  Switch

A **switch** is a networking device that connects multiple devices within a LAN using Ethernet cables.

Devices like:
- computers
- printers
- servers

are connected through switch ports.

Switches commonly have:

- 4 ports
- 8 ports
- 16 ports
- 24 ports
- 32 ports
- 64 ports

##  Why Switches Are Efficient

Unlike hubs, switches send data only to the intended device instead of broadcasting it to all devices.

This reduces network traffic and improves performance.

---

##  Redundancy with Switches

Multiple switches can be connected together for reliability.

If one path fails, another path can carry the traffic, reducing downtime.

#  Router

A **router** connects different networks together and directs traffic between them.

Example:
- Connects your home network to the Internet

---

##  What is Routing?

Routing is the process of determining the best path for data to travel from one network to another.

Routers analyze network information and forward data along the most efficient route.

##  Importance of Routers

Routers are used to:

- connect local networks to the Internet
- allow communication between multiple networks
- improve redundancy and reliability
- manage traffic between networks
